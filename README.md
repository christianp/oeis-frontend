This is a Flask app which serves a new frontend to the OEIS.

The aim is to produce pages with non-ancient HTML, and then to pay attention to visual presentation.

The OEIS server happily returns text files for its entries, but I don't know how happy they'd be about getting lots of traffic that way, so this is just a hobby project for me for now.
